Hi,
this is the momentary STAR firmware I have changed a bit

https://www.dropbox.com/s/txcu7hjwhp7l0i0/starmomentfirmw.c

Some small changes and some lines to make the turbostepdown like a slow
rampdown and it also ramps down on the two highest modes(200 and255) to the
mid(130)...

I am not sure if this is useful for other at all but maybe some things will
evolve into something useful.


I also have some minor improvements for the offtimememory

https://www.dropbox.com/s/u8kkye0p9jqs9s4/starfirmwarecapmemory.c

just added some small things to reduce the mcu current a bit, but I also
customized things(Star defaults like modeorder) which might confuse other
people.
