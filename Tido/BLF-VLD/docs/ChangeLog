	* BLF-VLD: release v0.4

	* driver.c: fixed initialisation of ADC

	* driver.c: added support for mode switching based on an I/O pin's 
	state

	* driver.c: fixed driver getting possibly stuck in extended mode if
	compiled without extended mode support and EEPROM gets corrupted.

	* driver.c: added compile time option for gradually lowering light 
	level in low battery situation

	* BLF-VLD: release v0.3
	
	* driver.c: mode functions can now be en/disabled without rearranging 
	modeline offsets
	
	* driver.c: EEPROM image configurations containing disabled mode 
	functions will result in compile time error

	* driver.c: added support for battery monitoring and handling of low
	battery voltage
	
	* driver.c: added wear levelling to mode switching to protect EEPROM

	* driver.c: added timer prescaling config option
