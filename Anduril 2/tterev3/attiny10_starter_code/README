I put together this simple flashlight example code for the ATTiny10 after a
request from Microa in my PIC quickstart thread, but it didn't seem appropriate
to post there. Hopefully it will help anyone getting started with coding for
ATTiny devices. This implements a simple 3-level light plus off using a
momentary switch and includes voltage monitoring. I hope it can provide a
foundation for anyone who wants to develop their own UIs. Let me know if there
are any questions about the implementation
