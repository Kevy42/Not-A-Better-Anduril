Hi
This project has been developing for several years.
From forum.fonarevka.ru/showthread.php?t=20782
This firmware - as Lego
you can choose what you need
for thermal control you need to solder the NTC thermistor to 3 and 4 legs

If you have any questions I will try to answer (but only with the use of Google Translate :)

----------------------- A new modification of LED driver Nanjg 105C . To work
in addition to the firmware you must first modify the driver 8x7135
http://avr.tamatronix.com/3-8x-amc7135-attiny13a-led-driver soldered capacitor 5uF
between the first leg of the MC and the ground. What can a modified driver :

That our driver is able to:
- Switching modes in one click.
- Three or four modes. *
- Switching down - from the powerful to the weak mode or weak to the powerful. *
- You can select currents: *
  * 0005mA - Included 1pc. AMC7135 and controlled PWM
  * 0075mA - Included 1 pc. AMC7135 and controlled PWM
  * 0175mA - Included 1 pc. AMC7135 and controlled PWM
  * 0350mA - Included 1 pc. AMC7135, PWM is not used
  * 0700mA - Includes 2 pcs. AMC7135, PWM is not used
  * 1050mA - Includes 3 pieces. AMC7135, PWM is not used
  * 1750mA - Includes 5 pieces. AMC7135, PWM is not used
  * 2100mA - Included 6 pcs. AMC7135, PWM is not used
  * 2450mA - Enabled 7units. AMC7135, PWM is not used
  * 2800mA - On 8 pieces. AMC7135, PWM is not used
- Calibrated protection from overheating or lack of such opportunities *
- Mode Memory or No memory mode *
- In an unconscious mode is possible to set the starting number mode *
- Option memory uses wear leveling. This means that our driver is not exhausted
  the resources of records in the EEPROM even with the most ruthless
  exploitation.
- Option without memory does not use record in the EEPROM when switching modes.
- Protection against contact bounce buttons - the driver will not randomly
  change modes and will not once again trigger protection against battery
  discharge or overheating.
- "Sucker" battery - switching to a low-current when the battery is critically
  low on voltage, and then completely turning the lamp at full charge.
- Displays the battery voltage is included three very quick click the power
  button. Fully charged - 5 blinks, unloaded - one flash.
- Status display temperature control ** If TC is disabled, the display after
  the battery driver includes 0.5 sec series of quick flashes.
- Strobe mode *
- Mode Alpine distress signal *
- You can select the number of short clicks to turn on the battery display
  modes, strobe and distress. *

* Select when compiling

source code version 2.0 from 20.05.2013 here . Example settings for specific
needs here . Home Page new fashion: http://avr.tamatronix.com/ To disable
thermocontrol enter the calibration mode and disable 2 seconds (instead of
short-click to save the value). Lamp turns on without a short gate and TC will
be disabled. 20/07/2013 Skompiliny HEX V2.1 and description in this post.
25.07.2013 source v2.2 . Some #define not work. 26/07/2013 Version 2.3 with
ramping and without gates. Video of the ramping and skompileny HEX here . The
source code here. For those who are not versed in the AVR Studio - a quick
tutorial here . Modification of DooMmen here .
