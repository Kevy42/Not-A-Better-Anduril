  As the source for luxdrv-0.30b already is published on the net could you
  consider to release it to the public domain? Please!  It's hands down the
  best starting point for writing your own avr drivers.

  You can use it as you want for free - unless you want to make money with it.

  To make things a bit clearer I changed the license to CC-BY-NC-SA (NC:
  non-commercial use only, SA: share-alike).

  I'm reluctant to remove the NC, since I don't like the idea of someone else
  earning money with my work (yes, there's some egoism involved).
