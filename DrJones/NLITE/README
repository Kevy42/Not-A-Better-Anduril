Since you can't backup the original NANJG firmware (it's protected, you only
get garbage if you try), you can't restore it's functionality if you flashed a
new firmware to it. Here's a firmware that is somewhat similar (i.e. the mode
group is selected by solder bridges between stars and the outer ring), but with
more and different groups that seem to be needed more often (no blink modes).

It's levels are 5%-33%-100% and optionally a moon mode (a few milliamperes,
depending on hardware variations like LED voltage).

star	open					closed (soldered)
1	The 1st star is a dummy and not connected anyway.
2	3 modes L/M/H				4 modes, additional moon level
3	ascending mode order (moon/)L/M/H	descending mode order H/M/L(/moon)
4	classic memory				no memory

Any combination is valid, so these are 8 groups in total and should meet most
people's needs.

Example: Moon/Low/Mid/High, no memory: Solder stars 2 and 4 to ground (the
outer ring).

It also has a PWM frequency of 18kHz, which is not visible and not audible (no
whining noises).

Battery monitoring: Whenever the battery falls below 3V under load, brightness
is reduced (about half).

Recommended fuses are low: 0x75, high: 0xFF.

Firmware download: nlite.hex, it's completely free (including commercial use).
Please consider sending me a message if you use it commercially (i.e. sell
drivers/dropins/lights etc); just for curiosity.
