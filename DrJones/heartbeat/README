This thread inspired me to make some heartbeat effect... It's greatly inspired
by hours of listening to the heartbeats of our children right before birth
(cardiotocography), sometimes with the pulse rate going up (usually when the
baby moves), sometimes down below good values, which always made my own
heartbeat rise... (Fortunately we didn't have much of those... My
implementation has more of them.)

It's random, but not as random as the examples above. I sort of shaped
randomness to get a less erratic, more organic effect.

I cleaned it up a bit...

The double pulse is just a ramp up, half a ramp down and up again, then back
down to 0.


Nice idea to react on visitors, an anthropophobic statue :)
