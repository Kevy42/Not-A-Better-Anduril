I cleaned up the UI and adopted the blink-on-power option from your Baton.c
code.

Here is the modified UI:

From OFF:

  * Short press turns ON to last mode.
  * Long press turns ON to moon.
  * Double press turn ON to turbo.

From ON:

  * Short press turns OFF.
  * Long press cycles to next mode. Keep pressing to continue cycling.
  * Double press cycles to previous mode. Keep pressing to continue cycling.

Notes:

  * There is no previous mode from moon. This is to prevent jarring transition
    from moon to turbo.
