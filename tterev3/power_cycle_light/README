This firmware has 3 modes:
  1. User-configurable brightness.
  2. Maximum brightness.
  3. 1Hz beacon.
It also has a hidden mode:
  4. Ramping config mode.

The default mode after a reset is mode 1.

To change modes while on:  Double-tap the button to turn it off/on twice.
To change modes while off:  Click once then quickly tap, to turn it on/off/on.

This firmware uses on-time memory.  In other words, if you leave it on for more
than half a second, it will not change modes after a power cycle.

To enter ramping mode:  Quickly tap the button until it stops cycling modes.

In ramping mode, the light will ramp brightness up and down.  When it gets to
the level you want, briefly tap the button to stop it and it will store that
level in mode 1.
